  More details are available in the Migration Guide listed below:

  - [Screen Share Migration Guide](https://www.100ms.live/docs/flutter/v2/how--to-guides/set-up-video-conferencing/screen-share#migrating-from-older-hmssdk-version-to-150-or-above)

## 1.3.0 - 2023-02-01

### Breaking

- Removed Start / Stop Capturing APIs on Local Video Tracks. Use `toggleCameraMuteState` to mute / unmute video of local peer as mentioned in Guide [here](https://www.100ms.live/docs/flutter/v2/how--to-guides/set-up-video-conferencing/mute).

### Added

- Added support for PIP Mode on iOS

  Now on iOS devices you can show a Picture-in-Picture(PIP) window while your app is in Background. You can configure the PIP window to show the Video of currently speaking Peer, or a Screenshare happening in Room, a Remote Peer's video in 1-to-1 Video Calls, etc

  To learn more about PIP & how to implement it in your apps, refer the PIP Guide [here](https://www.100ms.live/docs/flutter/v2/how--to-guides/set-up-video-conferencing/render-video/pip-mode#ios).

- Added `HMSPIPAndroidController` to easily configure & use PIP Mode on Android

  PIP Mode support was available on Android since version 1.0.0. With this release we have made it more easy & simple to setup PIP on Android devices. Use the new `HMSPIPAndroidController` class to configure & start playing your Live Videos when your app is in Background. Refer the PIP Guide [here](https://www.100ms.live/docs/flutter/v2/how--to-guides/set-up-video-conferencing/render-video/pip-mode#android).

- Added Capture Snapshot API to capture a frame of the video track being rendered

  With the new `captureSnapshot()` method on `HMSVideoTrack` you can instantly capture a frame of any Video being rendered on screen. You can use this to capture moments of a Peer's Video, or a Screenshare happening in Room, etc. To learn more about how to use Capture Snapshot refer the Guide [here](https://www.100ms.live/docs/flutter/v2/how--to-guides/set-up-video-conferencing/render-video/capture-snapshot).

### Deprecated

- Deprecated direct passing of AppGroup & PreferredExtension while building HMSSDK for iOS Screenshare. Use the new `HMSIOSScreenshareConfig` class for starting Screenshare from iOS Devices. For more details, refer the Screnshare Guide [here](https://www.100ms.live/docs/flutter/v2/how--to-guides/set-up-video-conferencing/screen-share).

- Deprecated `switchAudio` and `switchVideo` functions to mute/unmute Audio/Video of local peer. Use `toggleMicMuteState` and `toggleCameraMuteState` functions as mentioned in the Guide [here](https://www.100ms.live/docs/flutter/v2/how--to-guides/set-up-video-conferencing/mute).

### Fixed

- Corrected an issue where doing multiple Role Changes stopped working
- Corrected an issue where video views were getting recreated

Updated to Android SDK 2.5.7 & iOS SDK 0.6.2

Full Changelog: [1.2.0...1.3.0](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-flutter/compare/1.2.0...1.3.0)

## 1.2.0 - 2023-01-13

### Breaking

- Made `await` while building `HMSSDK` Required

  Adding `await` to the `build()` method was optional earlier. It has been made **Required** now to eliminate edge cases where SDK initialization did not complete before invocation of `join()` method. Adding `await` ensures that an instance of HMSSDK is available before any further usages.

  ```dart
  hmsSDK = HMSSDK();

  await hmsSDK.build(); // NEW: adding await while invoking build method on HMSSDK is now Required

  hmsSDK.addUpdateListener(this);
  HMSConfig config = HMSConfig(authToken: 'eyJH5c', // client-side token generated from your token service
                          userName: 'John Appleseed');
  hmsSDK.join(config: config);
  ```

### Added

- Added support for Adaptive Bitrate (Simulcast)

  Adaptive Bitrate refers to features that enable dynamic adjustments in video quality to optimize for end-user experience under diverse network conditions.

  To learn more about how ABR works & how it enhances your app, refer the guide [here](https://www.100ms.live/docs/flutter/v2/foundation/adaptive-bitrate).

- Using HMSVideoView on Android

  HMSVideoView on Android provides a better abstraction to render live video and handles edge cases like managing Release/Init states. It has in-built support to subscribe to video of the correct resolution.

  To learn more about Rendering Video, refer the guide [here](https://www.100ms.live/docs/flutter/v2/features/render-video).

- Added Simulcast support for RTC Stats

  RTC Call Stats are updated to show Simulcast layer data if available for Local Peer's Video Track. This can be used to diagnose user experience with metrics such as Audio/Video Bitrate, Round Trip Time, Packet loss, etc.

  To learn more about using RTC Call Stats, refer the guide [here](https://www.100ms.live/docs/flutter/v2/features/call-stats).

### Changed

- Sending correct `joined_at` property on Android indicating the time when the peer joins the Room

- Logging error messages when the App Group used for starting Screenshare from iOS is incorrect

- On Android, the `onJoin` updates will now be triggered before `onPeerUpdate` when a user joins the room

Updated to Android SDK 2.5.6 & iOS SDK 0.5.5

Full Changelog: [1.1.0...1.2.0](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-flutter/compare/1.1.0...1.2.0)

## 1.1.0 - 2022-12-17

### Added

- Added support for Bulk Role Change

  Bulk Role Change is used when you want to convert all Roles from a list of Roles, to another Role.

  For example, if peers join a room with a _Waiting_ Role and now you want to change all these peers to _Viewer_ Role then use the `changeRoleOfPeersWithRoles` API.

  ```dart
  // fetch all available Roles in the room
  List<HMSRole> roles = await hmsSDK.getRoles();

  // get the Host Role object
  HMSRole toHostRole = roles.firstWhere((element) => element.name == "host");

  // get list of Roles to be updated - in this case "Waiting" and "Guest" Roles
  roles.retainWhere((element) => ((element.name == "waiting") || (element.name == "guest")));

  // now perform Role Change of all peers in "Waiting" and "Guest" Roles to the "Host" Role
  hmsSDK.changeRoleOfPeersWithRoles(
      toRole: toHostRole,
      ofRoles: roles,
      hmsActionResultListener: hmsActionResultListener);
  ```

  For More Information, refer: https://www.100ms.live/docs/flutter/v2/features/change-role

- Added Switch Audio Output APIs on iOS

  Audio Output Routing is helpful when users want to switch output to a connected device other than the default one. This functionality is already available on Android.

  ```dart
  hmsSDK.switchAudioOutput(audioDevice: HMSAudioDevice.SPEAKER_PHONE);
  ```

  For More Information, refer: https://www.100ms.live/docs/flutter/v2/features/audio-output-routing

### Deprecated

- Deprecated `changeRole` API in favour of `changeRoleOfPeer`

  No change in functionality or method signature.

### Fixed

- Microphone not getting captured on Role Change from a non-publishing to publishing Role on iOS
- Corrected an issue where on iOS a default Audio Mixer was getting created if Track Settings was passed while building the HMSSDK instance

Updated to Native Android SDK 2.5.4 & Native iOS SDK 0.5.3

Full Changelog: [1.0.0...1.1.0](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-flutter/compare/1.0.0...1.1.0)

## 1.0.0 - 2022-12-09

### Added

- Added support for Picture in Picture mode on Android.

  PIP Mode lets the user watch the room video in a small window pinned to a corner of the screen while navigating between apps or browsing content on the main screen.

  Example implementation for checking device support & enabling PIP mode:

  ```dart
  // to start PIP mode invoke the `enterPipMode` function, the parameters passed to it are optional
  hmsSDK.enterPipMode(aspectRatio: [16, 9], autoEnterPip: true);

  // method to check whether PIP mode is available for current device
  bool isPipAvailable = await hmsSDK.isPipAvailable();

  // method to check whether PIP mode is active currently
  bool isPipActive = await hmsSDK.isPipActive();
  ```

- Added `roomPeerCountUpdated` type in `HMSRoomUpdate`

- Added `isPlaybackAllowed` to Remote Audio & Video Tracks to check if the track is allowed to be played locally

- Added convenience APIs to Mute / Unmute Audio or Video of the entire room locally

### Fixed
