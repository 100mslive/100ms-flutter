# onRoleChangeRequest method




    *[<Null safety>](https://dart.dev/null-safety)*




void onRoleChangeRequest
({required [HMSRoleChangeRequest](../../hmssdk_flutter/HMSRoleChangeRequest-class.md) roleChangeRequest})





<p>This is called when someone asks for change or role</p>
<p>for eg. admin can ask a peer to become host from guest.
this triggers this call on peer's app</p>



## Implementation

```dart
void onRoleChangeRequest({required HMSRoleChangeRequest roleChangeRequest});
```
