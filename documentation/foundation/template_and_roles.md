# Templates and Roles

## Introduction

Template is the blueprint of the room. It defines the settings of the room along with the behavior of users who are part of it. Room will inherit the properties from a template that you have specified while creating it. If you have not specified any template then it will pick the default template. Each template will be identified by its id. E.g. <span style="color:blue">default_videoconf_7e450ffc-8ef1-4572-ab28-b32474107b89</span>

Users can see or modify the templates by visiting <span style="color:blue">Templates</span>
