# Chat

What's a video without being able to send messages to each other too? 100ms supports chat for every video/audio room you create.

You can see an example of every way of sending messages and interpreting messages in the advanced sample app.

```dart 
HMSMeeting meeting = new HMSMeeting();
meeting.sendMessage("Hi");
```

You will get updates about message sent by someone in `HMSUpdateListener`.

```dart
void onMessage({required HMSMessage message});
```
