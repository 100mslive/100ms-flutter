What's a video call without being able to send messages to each other too? 100ms supports chat for every video/audio room you create.

You can see an example of every type of message (of the types below) being sent and displayed in the advanced [sample app](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-android/).

### Addressing messages

* [Broadcast messages](#sending-broadcast-messages) are sent to Everyone in the chat `meeting.sendBroadcastMessage`.

* [Direct messages](#sending-direct-messages) are sent to a specific person `meeting.sendDirectMessage`.

* [Group messages](#sending-group-messages) are sent to everyone with a particular `HMSRole`. Such as all `hosts` or all `teachers` or all `students` `meeting.sendGroupMessage`.
    * Learn more about [roles](../foundation/templates-and-roles) and how to create them on the backend.

## Sending Chat Messages


### Sending Broadcast Messages

Want to let everyone in the chat know something? Call `sendBroadcastMessage` on the instance of `HMSMeeting` to send a broadcast.

The parameters are:

1. *message*: The text of the message.



> ðŸ’¡ Note that the callback only lets you know if the server has received your request for the message or if there was some error.
>
>It does not convey whether the message was delivered to or read by the recipient.
>
>Also it's important to make a new callback per message because it will only contain the results of that particular call for sending a message.




```dart
HMSMeeting meeting = new HMSMeeting();
meeting.sendMessage("Hi");
```

#### Sending Direct Messages

Got secrets to share? Send a message directly to a single person in the chat with a direct message. Call `sendDirectMessage` on an instance of `HMSMeeting`.

The parameters are:

1. *message*: The text of the message.
2. *peerId*: The `HMSPeer` instance id  who should receive message.


> ðŸ’¡ Note that the callback only lets you know if the server has received your request for the message or if there was some error.
>
>It does not convey whether the message was delivered to or read by the recipient.
>
>Also it's important to make a new callback per message because it will only contain the results of that particular call for sending a message.



```dart
HMSMeeting meeting = new HMSMeeting();
meeting.sendDirectMessage(String message,String peerId);
```


#### Sending Group Messages

Need to call attention to all the hosts? All the teachers? All the developers? Call `sendGroupMessage` on an instance of `HMSMeeting`.

The parameters are:

1. *message*: The text of the message.
2. *roleName*: The name of the role.


> ðŸ’¡ Note that the callback only lets you know if the server has received your request for the message or if there was some error.
>
>It does not convey whether the message was delivered to or read by the recipient.
>
>Also it's important to make a new callback per message because it will only contain the results of that particular call for sending a message.

```dart
HMSMeeting meeting = new Meeting();
meeting.sendGroupMessage(String message,String roleName);
```

### Receiving Chat Messages

When you called `meeting.join(config)` to join a room, the `HMSUpdateListener` implementation that was passed in had the callback `fun onMessageReceived(message: HMSMessage)`.

This where you'll receive new messages as `HMSMessage` during the call. It contains:

```dart
class HMSMessage(

  final String sender;
  final String message;
  final String type;
  final String time;
  HMSMessageRecipient? hmsMessageRecipient;

  HMSMessage({
    required this.sender,
    required this.message,
    required this.type,
    required this.time,
    this.hmsMessageRecipient
  });
)
```

* message: Content of the text message or the text description of the raw message.
* type: Type of message sent. Default value is `chat`.
* recipient: The intended recipient(s) of this message as a `HMSMessageRecipient`.
* serverReceiveTime: timestamp of when the messaging server receives this message. Update the time in your own messages when this comes back from the server in `HMSUpdateListener.onMessageReceived` for accurate ordering of your own messages.
* sender: The `HMSPeer` who is sending this message.

Identifying Senders:

The sender of a message is always contained in the `sender` field of HMSMessage. This lets you get the name and peer id for any message sender.

Message Body:

The body of the message is in `message` as a String.

Time:

The time the message was sent is contained in `time` as a Java Date.

### Putting together a list of chat messages.
The UI is completely up to you to decide! You'll also need to hold onto all the received messages if you want to display history.

#### Identifying who the message was for

The HMSMessageRecipient contained in the `recipient` field of `HMSMessage` lets you know who the message was for.

The `HMSMessageRecipient` contains:

```dart
class HMSMessageRecipient{
    HMSPeer? recipientPeer;
    List<HMSRole>? recipientRoles;
    HMSMessageRecipientType hmsMessageRecipientType;
}
```

recipientPeer: Only contains a peer when a specific single peer is being direct messaged.

recipientRoles: Only contains values when a group message is being sent to many roles.

recipientType: Will be `HMSMessageRecipientType.BROADCAST` for a message being sent to everyone. If this is true, the other two fields will be null and empty respectively.

`HMSMessageRecipientType.PEER` will be set when it's a direct message.

`HMSMessageRecipientType.ROLES` will be set when it's a message to one or many roles.
