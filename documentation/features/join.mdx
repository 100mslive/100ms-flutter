nav: 3.1

Joining a room is one of the most basic functionalities so we at 100ms have built an easy, developer friendly API to get you started.

A user can interact with participants of a room only after joining the room.

When user indicates that they want to join the room, your app should have -

1. User Name, the name which should be displayed to other peers in the room
2. User ID, a unique identifier for the user. Usually a UUID string.
3. Room ID, the unique room identifier which would have been generated & passed to your app from the backend.
4. Authentication Token, the client side authentication token generated by your Token Service.


Now that you have aforementioned data, you can proceed to join a room.

1. First, generate an auth token using any http request package 
   available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/) we are using [http](https://pub.dev/packages/http) package.

   ```dart
   Future<String> getToken({required String user, required String room}) async {
        http.Response response = await http.post(Uri.parse  (Constant.getTokenURL),
            body: {'room_id': room, 'user_id': user, 'role': Constant.defaultRole});

        var body = json.decode(response.body);
        return body['token'];
    }
   ```
    you need to do POST request at the endpoint generated which is present in your dashboard.
    You need three parameters to make POST request.

    `room_id`: room id. `user_id`: name you want. 
    `role`: role you want.


2. Next, create an object of HMSConfig class using the available  joining configurations

   ```dart
   HMSConfig config = HMSConfig(userId: Uuid().v1(),
                                authToken: token,
                                userName: user);
   ```

3. You'll want to handle the callbacks from joining the room by making your ViewModel, Presenter or whatever you're using to handle business logic implement the HMSUpdateListener interface and overriding the methods.

4. Now, we are primed to join the room. All you have to do is pass the config object to `joinMeeting` present in `HMSMeeting` class.

   Create instance of HMSMeeting -
   ```dart
   HMSMeeting meeting = new HMSMeeting();
   ```

   Now join by passing config object created in previous step.
   ```dart
   meeting.joinMeeting(config);
   ```

That's it. You have joined a room successfully. ðŸ¥³
