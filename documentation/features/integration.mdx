## Device Permissions

### Android 

Camera, Recording Audio and Internet permissions are required. Add them to your AndroidManifest.xml.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

You will also need to request Camera and Record Audio permissions at runtime before you join a call or display a preview. Please follow [Android Documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting#request-permission) for runtime permissions.

### iOS

Add the entitlements for video, audio and network access to your Info.plist

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow access to Camera to enable video calling.</string>
<key>NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow access to Camera to network to enable video calling.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow access to Camera to mic to enable video calling.</string>

```

You will also need to request Camera and Record Audio permissions at runtime before you join a call or display a preview.
