  hmssdk_flutter:
```

## Setting up the library

Run following in command in terminal.

flutter run
```
## Device Permissions

### Android 

Camera, Recording Audio and Internet permissions are required. Add them to your AndroidManifest.xml.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

You will also need to request Camera and Record Audio permissions at runtime before you join a call or display a preview. Please follow [Android Documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting#request-permission) for runtime permissions.

### Update target Android version

Update the Android SDK version to 21 or later by navigating to the directory and updating the android/app/build.gradle file

```xml
defaultConfig{
  minSdkVersion 21
  â€¦
}
```

### iOS

Add the entitlements for video, audio and network access to your Info.plist

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow access to Camera to enable video calling.</string>
<key>NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow access to Camera to network to enable video calling.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow access to Camera to mic to enable video calling.</string>
```

You will also need to request Camera and Record Audio permissions at runtime before you join a call or display a preview.


## Debugging Tools
 
You can use [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) & [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) to develop application with 100ms.

## Proguard configuration

### 100ms Android SDK 2.1.2 or higher

If using 100ms Android SDK version 2.1.2 and higher proguard configuration is bundled inside it. No additional code is required.

### Prior to Android SDK version 2.1.2
Prior to Android SDK version 2.1.2, the following configuration was needed in release builds.

Add it to your proguard-rules.pro

# 100ms proguard rules
-keep class org.webrtc.** { *; }
-keep class live.hms.video.** { *; }
```
