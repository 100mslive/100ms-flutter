Done with talking and it's time to end the video call room for everyone not just yourself? You may be looking to end the room.

### Permissions

Can't let just anyone end the video call room. First you need to create a [role](../foundation/templates-and-roles) with the permissions to end a room.

The permission to end a room is called `PermissionsParams.endRoom` and you should check for that within the `HMSRole` of the peer to see if they have it.

Here's how to check whether the local peer has the permission to end the room:


```dart
Future<bool> isAllowedToEndMeeting() async{
    return (await hmsSDK.getLocalPeer()).role.permission?.endRoom;
}
```

`hmsSdk.getLocalPeer()` will not return null as long as you're in a preview or in a meeting. Since you likely won't need to check for permissions if you're not in one it would be ok.

### Ending the Room

Once you're sure the peer has the permissions to end the room, they can end it by calling `meeting.endRoom`.

`endRoom` takes one parameters.


*lock*: A Boolean for whether you want to prevent anyone from rejoining the room. If false, they will be allowed to enter the room again if the client called `join`. If this is true, they will NOT able to join this room again.


> ðŸ’¡ After calling endRoom the video calling UI should be disposed of as well since only the other peers will get the `onPeerRemoved` callback. The caller has to rely on the `onSuccess` callback for `endRoom` to decide when to terminate the meeting room UI locally.


### How to handle an end room callback for receivers

Once the peer with adequate permissions calls `endRoom`, all other peers in the room will receive a callback in `HMSUpdateListener.onRemovedFromRoom`.

The `onRemovedFromRoom` callback has a single parameter called `HMSRemovedFromRoom` with the following structure.

```dart
class HMSRemovedFromRoom(
    val reason : String,
    val peerWhoRemoved : HMSPeer?,
    val roomWasEnded : Boolean
)
```

> ðŸ’¡ This is the same callback that will be triggered if a peer was [removed from a room](Remove-Peer) as well. Except that `roomEnded` will be true when the entire room was ended.

* *reason*: The string message detailing why the room was ended.
* *peerWhoRemoved*: The details of the peer who called `endRoom`.
* *roomWasEnded*: True if the entire room was ended. False if only the receiving peer was removed.

Clients should read this callback and show the appropriate UI.
