Flutter SDK provides support for sharing the entire screen of the device to the room.

Please note that for a peer to share their screen, their role must have screenshare enabled in the dashboard. Also select the appropriate resolution that you desire the screenshare track should be of.

## How to start screenshare from the app

To start screen share, app needs to call the `startScreenshare` method of `HMSMeeting`.

Following is the snippet on how to use this:

<Tabs id="startscreenshare" items={["Dart"]} />

<Tab id='startscreenshare-0'>

```dart

  hmsMeeting.startScreenShare()

```

</Tab>

## How to get Screen Share Status

Application needs to call the `isScreenShareActive` method of `HMSSDK`.

This method returns a `Boolean` which will be true inscase ScreenShare is currently active and being used, and False for inactive state.

<Tabs id="screensharestatus" items={["Dart"]} />

<Tab id='screensharestatus-0'>

```dart

  hmsMeeting.isScreenShareActive()

```

</Tab>

## How to stop screenshare

To stop the screenshare, you need to invoke `stopscreenShare` method of `HmsMeeting`

<Tabs id="stopscreenshare" items={["Dart"]} />

<Tab id='stopscreenshare-0'>

```dart

  hmsMeeting.stopScreenShare()

```
