When you make an API call to access an HMS SDK, the SDK may return error codes. ErrorCodes are returned when a problem that cannot be recovered without app intervention has occurred.

These are returned as `HMSException` in the onError callback of the `HMSUpdateListner`.

Following are the different error codes that are returned by the SDK . Before returning any error code, SDK retries the errors (whichever is possible).

| Error Code  | Cause of the error | Action to be taken     |
