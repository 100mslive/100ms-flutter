# Render Video

It all comes down to this. All the setup so far has been done so that we can show live streaming videos in our beautiful app.

To render video you will use HMSVideoView. To use it we will need few things:

1. HMSTrack: `HMSVideoView` will render video using trackId from HMSTrack.
2. `HMSVideoView` will use viewSize to get height and width of rendered video. If not passed, it will take whatever size is available to the widget.

## How to get HMSTrack 

HMSTrack is used to render video in HMSVideoView.

And you can get all tracks by listening to `HMSUpdateListener.onTrackUpdate`

Add a check on these tracks to see if they are video tracks or audio tracks.

For example -
```dart
/// check if track is video or audio

/// For Audio
track.kind == HMSTrackKind.kHMSTrackKindAudio

/// For Video
track.kind == HMSTrackKind.kHMSTrackKindVideo
```

Now, you can pass video track to `HMSVideoView ` to get you live video on screen.

## Render Video

To Render video you need track and size(optional).

For example - HMSVideoView with `HMSTrack` and `Size`

```dart
///  This will render video with trackId present in track and it will have height = 50 and width = 50

HMSVideoView(
  track: track,
  viewSize: Size(50,50),
);
```

For example - HMSVideoView with only `HMSTrack`

```dart
///  This will render video with trackId present in track and it will have height and width available to it

HMSVideoView(
  track: track,
  viewSize: Size(50,50),
);
```

## Detach video to conserve bandwidth and cleanup elements

Remove the HMSVideoView from UI and it will not render its video & conserve network bandwidth.
