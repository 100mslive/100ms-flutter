## Prerequisites

Familiarity with Android Studio and the <a>fundamentals</a> of android apps.
<br><br>

## Supported Android API Levels
<br>
100ms's Android SDK supports Android API level 21 and higher. It is built for armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, x86, and x86_64 architectures.
<br><br>

### Getting the video call joining link
<br>
To join a video call you need an authentication token and a room id. Or a server that will translate the link into them. The <a>100ms Dashboard</a> is one way to generate these auth tokens. In production your own server will generate these and manage user authentication.<br>
<br>
Links created by the dashboard will stop working after 10k minutes of video calls. You'll need to setup your own server after.<br>
<br>

For the purposes of this quickstart you can rely on just the 100ms dashboard. Sign up for the 100ms Dashboard <a>here</a>.

From either the dashboard, or your own server once implemented, you need to generate a video call link. Video call links generated by the 100ms Dashboard look like `https://myname.app.100ms.live/meeting/correct-horse-battery`.

<br>
⚙️ &nbsp;&nbsp; For Production <br>
<br>

With your own server for authentication and link generation, the format of the link is up to you.
