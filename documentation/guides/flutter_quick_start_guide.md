## Prerequisites

Familiarity with the <a>fundamentals</a> of flutter apps.
<br><br>


### Getting the video call joining link
<br>
To join a video call you need an authentication token and a room id. Or a server that will translate the link into them. The <a>100ms Dashboard</a> is one way to generate these auth tokens. In production your own server will generate these and manage user authentication.<br>
<br>
Links created by the dashboard will stop working after 10k minutes of video calls. You'll need to setup your own server after.<br>
<br>

For the purposes of this quickstart you can rely on just the 100ms dashboard. Sign up for the 100ms Dashboard <a>here</a>.

From either the dashboard, or your own server once implemented, you need to generate a video call link. Video call links generated by the 100ms Dashboard look like `https://myname.app.100ms.live/meeting/correct-horse-battery`.

<br>
⚙️ &nbsp;&nbsp; For Production <br>
<br>

With your own server for authentication and link generation, the format of the link is up to you.

<br>

### Add SDK dependencies
Add the `hmssdk_flutter` plugin in dependencies of pubspec.yaml

```dart: #pubspec.yaml

dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  hmssdk_flutter:
```

### Login
### Request

Here's how to get an auth token with 100ms's demo authentication

1. Sign up to the dashboard.
2. Get your video call link. It should look like `https://myname.app.100ms.live/meeting/correct-horse-battery`
Send an http post request to `https://prod-in.100ms.live/hmsapi/get-token`
3. With the header "subdomain" set to `myname.app.100ms.live` if your link was `https://myname.app.100ms.live/meeting/correct-horse-battery`
4. For a link of the type `https://myname.app.100ms.live/meeting/correct-horse-battery` The body is json with the format `{"code": "correct-horse-battery", "user_id":"your-customer-id" }` the user_id can be any random string as well and you can create it with `UUID.randomUUID().toString()`


<br>
⚙️ &nbsp;&nbsp; For Production <br>
<br>

Maybe you won't use links at all. You will need to generate tokens on the backend, and rooms for users. Look up the Token Setup Guide here.
<br>

### Response
The 100ms server will respond with an auth token like this <span style="color:blue">`{"token":"some-token-string"}`</span>.

### Android Permissions
Camera, Recording Audio and Internet permissions are required. Add them to your AndroidManifest.xml.

```xml:
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />

```

You will also need to request Camera and Record Audio permissions at runtime before you join a call or display a preview. Please follow `Android Documentation` for runtime permissions.
