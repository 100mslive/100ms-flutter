## Steps to run hms_room_kit with flutterflow

`hms_room_kit` manages state and UI out of the box, but there are some conflicts with flutterflow. So, we need to make some changes in the app layer. Please follow the steps below to run the app:

1. Solving dependency conflicts:

<img width="526" alt="Screenshot 2023-11-20 at 11 00 18â€¯AM" src="https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-flutter/assets/93931528/810b96ca-d268-4681-b073-56b4df35de51">

There are several packages which are common in both `flutterflow` and `hms_room_kit`, but with different versions. So, we need to make sure that the versions of these packages are same in both `pubspec.yaml` files. For conflict in packages you will get error like this:

```bash
Error: Failed running flutter pub get...
Because custom_widget depends on flutter_cache_manager 3.3.0 which depends on http ^0.13.0, http ^0.13.0 is required.
So, because custom_widget depends on http ^1.0.0, version solving failed.


You can try the following suggestion to make the pubspec resolve:
* Try upgrading your constraint on flutter_cache_manager: flutter pub add flutter_cache_manager:^3.3.1
```

This can be solved by updating to the higher version of the package. For example, in the above error, we need to update `flutter_cache_manager` to `^3.3.1` in `pubspec.yaml` file.

> ðŸ”‘ Note: Flutterflow UI doesn't directly allow changing the package version, either you need to do it in `Custom Widgets` section or you can download the code from flutterflow and change the version in `pubspec.yaml` file locally. We recommend doing the later since it's much easier.

2. Issues with Navigator:

Flutterflow uses `go_router` whereas `hms_room_kit` uses `MaterialPageRoute` for navigation. So, you might face issues while navigating from app screen to `hms_room_kit` screen. To solve this, you will need to use `MaterialPageRoute` while pushing the `hms_room_kit` path while you can continue using `go_router` for other paths.

That's it. You can now use the amazing Prebuilt UI with speed of flutterflow in your application.
