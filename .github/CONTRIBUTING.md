# Contributing

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! Any contribution you make will be reflected on [100ms Docs](https://docs.100ms.live/) If you don't know where to start contributing, ask us on our [Discord channel](http://100ms.live/discord).

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## Code of conduct

Read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing

## Getting started guides

We have created a very detailed guide to setup this repo locally you can checkout it out [here](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-flutter#-getting-started)

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a [new issue](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-flutter/issues/new).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-flutter/issues) to find one that interests you. Leave a comment on the issue asking if you can pick up the issue so maintainers knowing you want to work on it.

### Pull Request

When you're done making the changes, open a pull request, often referred to as a PR.

-   Fill out the PR description summarizing your changes so we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes and the purpose of your pull request.
-   Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
-   Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge. Once you submit your PR, a Docs team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.
-   We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
-   As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
-   If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
