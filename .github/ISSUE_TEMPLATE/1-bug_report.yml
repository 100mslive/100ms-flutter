        Please provide a minimal code example that reproduces the problem or a link to a repository on GitHub.
        You may provide a screenshot of the application if you think it is relevant to your bug report.
        Here are some tips for providing a minimal example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve

        You can use `flutter create bug` command and update the `main.dart` file.
        Alternatively, you can use https://dartpad.dev/
        which is capable of creating and running small Flutter apps.
        Without this we will unlikely be able to progress on the issue, and because of that
        we regretfully will have to close it.

        Include the full logs of the commands you are running between the lines
        with the backticks below. If you are running any `flutter` commands,
        please include the output of running them with `--verbose`; for example,
        the output of running `flutter --verbose create foo`.

        If the logs are too large to be uploaded to Github, you may upload
        them as a `txt` file or use online tools like https://pastebin.com to
        share it.

        Note: Please do not upload screenshots of text. Instead, use code blocks
        or the above mentioned ways to upload logs.
